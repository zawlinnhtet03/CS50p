# Snake Game Project

## Description

This Snake Game project is a classic console-based game implemented in C++ for Windows using the `windows.h` library. The game provides an interactive gaming experience where players control a snake, collect food, and aim to achieve the highest score without colliding with the snake's own body or walls. The project offers a fun and nostalgic gaming experience reminiscent of the classic Snake games that were popular on early mobile phones and handheld devices.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

### main.cpp
- This file contains the main game logic, including the movement of the snake, food generation, and collision detection. It also handles user input using the `windows.h` library's console functions.

### snake.h and snake.cpp
- These files contain the definitions and implementations of the `Snake` class, which encapsulates the game's behavior. It includes member functions for initializing the game, rendering the game screen, and handling game over conditions.

### [Other File Names]
- Describe other files as needed. For example, if the project contains utility functions, additional classes, or data files, provide details about their roles and contents.

## Game Controls

- Players can use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- The objective is to navigate the snake to collect the food items that appear on the screen and grow the snake's length.
- Players must avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake's own body, which results in a game over.

## Design Choices

Several design choices were made to create a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience:

- The game board is bounded by walls to create a confined play area, increasing the challenge for players.
- The speed of the snake's movement was chosen to strike a balance between difficulty and playability.
- The appearance of food items and the snake itself was designed for clarity and retro aesthetics.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

3. Compile and run the code within the development environment.

## Game Over

- When the game ends, the player's final score is displayed.
- Players can choose to restart the game or exit to the main menu.
